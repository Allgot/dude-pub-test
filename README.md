Error: I cannot find the root of the current workspace/project.
If you would like to create a new dune project, you can type:
    dune init project NAME
Otherwise, please make sure to run dune inside an existing project or
workspace. For more information about how dune identifies the root of the
current workspace/project, please refer to
https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#finding-the-root
